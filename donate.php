      <p  class="lead">To help support the work of God in our community and around the world.</p>
      <p  class="lead">In Scripture, we are often challenged to give to meet the needs of others and to invest earthly treasures in the growth of God’s eternal kingdom. Not only is the act of giving important, but the attitude behind the gift is also important.</p>
      <p  class="lead">“He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work” (II Corinthians 9:6–8).”</p>
      <p  class="lead">Every Christian should faithfully give a tithe of his income to his local church. This discipline provides financially for his spiritual leaders and ensures that the work of God is supported in his community. Gifts beyond the tithe may be given to support other ministries, and organizations.</p>
      <p  class="lead">God is generous, and as His children, we should reflect a family resemblance to our Father. As you joyfully steward your resources with wisdom, you can share the bounty of God’s provision with people who are in need.
