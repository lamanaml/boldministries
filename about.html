Why we are doing this? 
● Vision 
Our love and vision centers around God’s people knowing the word of God, living the word of God and ul mately falling in love with God to be His true disciples. Our objec ve is to teach the word of God in its raw form and allow the HOLY SPIRIT to minister to each of us as HE directs our path. 
Our discipleship ministry focuses on the life cycles of a disciple from birth to reproducing other disciples. 
We have established an environment where believers can get away from tradi ons and focus on their spiritual growth. We want to foster an environment where you can feel comfortable asking about areas of ministry and not feel pressured to ask or look a par cular way but are allowed to be who God has created you to be. We are driven by the great commission to make disciples Ma . 28:19-20. 
In addi on, we are burdened by our Lord and Savior descrip on of the righteous as defined in Ma . 
25:35-36, When I was hungry you gave me meat. Therefore, we are also focused on the needs of others through our outreach into the community and support to ministries that feed the hungry around the world.
